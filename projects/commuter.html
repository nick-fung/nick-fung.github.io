        <h1>Diary of a Commuter</h1>
        <h2>Motivation and Goals</h2>
        <p>For the first couple months of the school, I've been commuting to and from UBC by
        bike; after all, it's only a twelve minute bike ride. Then it started raining. And then 
        it started getting cold. That made me wonder - how does the weather affect my travel 
        patterns? What about my travel time to school? The goals of this project - 
        which I've yet to decide a name for - is primarily to learn the basics of web development,
        as I have no prior experience and I thought it would be fun to do over Winter break. 
        Additionally, as I haven't had any stats or data analytics courses, this project makes
       lets me kill two birds with one stone. </p>
