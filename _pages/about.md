ML engineer and data scientist with experience in applications in quantitative finance, as well as a background studying computer engineering at UofT and UBC.

As a self-proclaimed nerd, I'm driven by my deep and incessant need to learn more about the world, as well as a desire to build things that have a positive and lasting impact on people’s lives.

My _oh-so-unique_ hobbies include: Coffee, board games, climbing, Brazillian jiu-jitsu, working out, travelling, and personal finance.
