ML engineer and data scientist with experience in applications in quantitative finance, and a background in computer engineering.

I'm driven by my deep need to learn about the world, and a desire to build things that have a positive and lasting impact on people’s lives.

My _oh-so-unique_ hobbies include: Coffee, board games, climbing, Brazillian jiu-jitsu, working out, cooking, travelling, and personal finance.
